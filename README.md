# inventorymanager
Track, Add, Edit and Delete Inventory

This application uses the Python Django framework. It is capable of adding inventory and selecting which category the inventory is associated with. You may also edit the quanity, name and category as well as delete the entire entry. 

The inventory manager also utilizes authentication for signing in as well as creating a new account. Right now the admin holds all permissions while other users only have basic permissions. This can be easily adjusted in the admin page for the application.
